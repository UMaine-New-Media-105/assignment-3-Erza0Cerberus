Catcher

For this assignment we were to create a catcher; basically create something that is going to be used to catch something else in the game we make later on.
I decided once again to go with my shape that resembles the character Sonic The Hedgehog as my plan is to create a silly knock off of the real games.

For this assignment we were to edit our original catcher so that when/if the mouse is pressed something about the catcher changes.
For my catcher I made it so when the mouse is pressed the eyes and outer body of my catcher change colors!

Drop Seed

For this assignment we were asked to make a "seed" that dropped at random from the top of the screen. To do this I used the if command to create my seed and used the "random" to allow my seed to fall at random.
